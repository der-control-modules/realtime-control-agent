    """MESA Low/High Voltage Ride-Through emergency mode. Covers both the low and high
    sides (DNP3 DHVT logical node) via four voltage thresholds:

      - high_must_trip / low_must_trip: beyond these the DER must trip (disconnect);
        output is forced to zero.
      - high_momentary_cessation / low_momentary_cessation: within the ride-through band
        but past these thresholds, the DER must cease output (hold zero) while staying
        connected.
      - otherwise: normal ride-through, output passes through unchanged.

    New native implementation (no Julia fallback). This models the trip/cessation
    thresholds as instantaneous voltage limits; it does not model the time-duration
    curves of the full IEEE 1547 ride-through envelope or breaker reconnect timers.
    Thresholds are in the same units as the metered voltage (e.g. volts, or per-unit if
    the meter reports per-unit).
