    """MESA Low/High Frequency Ride-Through emergency mode. Covers both the low and high
    sides (DNP3 DHFT logical node) via four frequency thresholds:

      - high_must_trip / low_must_trip: beyond these the DER must trip (disconnect);
        output is forced to zero.
      - high_momentary_cessation / low_momentary_cessation: within the ride-through band
        but past these thresholds, the DER must cease output (hold zero) while staying
        connected.
      - otherwise: normal ride-through, output passes through unchanged.

    New native implementation (no Julia fallback). Models the trip/cessation thresholds
    as instantaneous frequency limits (Hz); it does not model the time-duration curves
    of the full IEEE 1547 ride-through envelope or breaker reconnect timers.
